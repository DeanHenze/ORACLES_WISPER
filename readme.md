# WISPER ORACLES data processing and calibration
ORACLES (ObseRvations of Aerosols above CLouds and their intEractionS) is a NASA earth science field experiment with three Intensive Observation Periods (IOP) designed to study key processes that determine the climate impacts of African BB aerosols. More information on the ORACLES field experiment: https://espo.nasa.gov/oracles/content/ORACLES.

The ORACLES experiment included aircraft measurements of the heavy water isotope ratios D/H and 18O/16O of atmospheric water vapor and cloud water. Isotope ratio measurements were taken with the Water Isotope System for Precipitation and Entrainment Research (WISPER).
